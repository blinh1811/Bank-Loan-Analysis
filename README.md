# Bank Loan Analysis Project

## Overview

The **Bank Loan Analysis** project aims to analyze and assess the factors influencing the approval, disbursement, and repayment of loans within financial institutions. The goal is to gain insights into patterns of loan defaults, approval rates, and factors that affect borrowersâ€™ ability to repay loans. By examining historical loan data, this project helps identify trends and make data-driven decisions for improving loan offerings and risk management strategies.

Key objectives of this project include:
- **Loan Default Prediction**: Analyzing customer and loan data to predict the likelihood of loan defaults.
- **Loan Approval Factors**: Understanding which factors (e.g., credit score, income, loan type) most influence loan approval.
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifying potential risks in loan portfolios by evaluating the relationship between loan characteristics and repayment behavior.
- **Repayment Patterns**: Analyzing repayment trends and predicting future repayment behavior based on borrower history and loan type.

## Key Features:
- **Data Collection & Cleaning**: Gathering and preprocessing loan-related data such as customer demographics, loan types, repayment history, and credit scores.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and analyzing key trends, correlations, and patterns within the dataset.
- **Modeling & Prediction**: Building predictive models to assess the risk of loan default and factors influencing loan repayment.
- **Visualization**: Creating dashboards and reports to present findings and support decision-making for risk management and loan strategy improvements.
